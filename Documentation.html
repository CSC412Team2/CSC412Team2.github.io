					<h2>TelevEyes Documentation</h2>
					<p><h1>Overview</h1>
					TelevEyes is an app that keeps track of all the television
					shows you watch. The app notifies you when the next episode of one of your shows is getting ready to air. It notifies you when the new season of your show or new series
					of a show is getting ready to premeire. The TelevEyes app also keeps you updated on any changes that could occur during the show's run. You'll receive updates
					if the show has been cancelled or renewed, changed stations, air dates, and air times.
					</p>
					<p><h1>Android Studio</h1>
					The official IDE for Android development. Android Studio provides the fastest tools for building apps on every type of Android device. World-class code editing, debugging, 
					performance tooling, a flexible build/deploy system all allow you to focus on building unique and high quality apps.
					<p><ul>
						<h3><li>Instant Run</li></h3>
						Push code and resource changes to your app running on a device or emulator and see the changes instantly come to life. Instant Run dramtically speeds up your edit, build,
						and run cycles, keeping you "in the flow."
						<h3><li>Intelligent Code Editor</li></h3>
						Write better code, work faster, and be more productive with an intelligent code editor that helps you each step of the way. Android Studio is built on IntelliJ and is capable
						of advanced code completion, refactoring, and code analysis.
						<h3><li>Fast and Feature-Rich Emulator</li></h3>
						Install and run your apps faster than with a physical device and test your app on virtually any Android device configuration: Android phones, Android tablets, Android Wear, 
						and Android TV devices. The new Android Emulator 2.0 is faster than ever and allows you to dynamically resize the emulator and access a suite of sensor controls.
						<h3><li>Robust and Flexible Build System</li></h3>
						Easily configure your project to include code libraries and generate multiple build variants from a single project. With Gradle, Android Studio offers high-performance build 
						automation, robust dependency management, and customizable build configurations.
						<h3><li>Develop For All Android Devices</li></h3>
						Target multiple form factors with a single project to easily share code among your different versions of your app. Android Studio provides a unified environment to develop 
						apps for Android phones, tablets, Android Wear, Android TV, and Android Auto.
						<h3><li>Code Templates and GitHub Integration</li></h3>
						Start projects with code templates for patterns such as navigation drawer and view pagers, or import Google code samples from GitHub. Android Studio's project wizards make it 
						easier than ever to add code in a new project.
